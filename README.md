# Azure Resource Creation Showcase
I'm an IT Remote Technician (Level 2) with over 4 years of experience supporting end users and all types of devices ‚Äî from networking equipment to Endpoint devices ‚Äî mainly in Microsoft environments.

I‚Äôve gained hands-on experience with both Azure and AWS, and I‚Äôm currently focusing on Azure as I prepare to transition into a Cloud Support or Cloud Engineer role.

To strengthen my skills, I completed full-time training with an official instructor to prepare for the AZ-104 certification. While I haven't taken the exam yet, I‚Äôm actively studying and building labs to become more confident in managing Azure resources.

This repository is where I‚Äôll be showcasing the Azure resources I can create and manage. Some examples will be simple, while others will involve more advanced configurations.
