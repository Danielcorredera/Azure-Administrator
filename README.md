# Azure-Administrator
Azure creation resources showcase.

I'm a IT Remote technician lvl 2 with more than 4 years of experience supporting end users and devices, mostly for Microsoft enviroments. I gained experience on Azure and AWS. 
I'm working on this project for only Azure to make a transition to Cloud Support or Cloud Engineer, I took a full-time training with an oficial instructor to get my AZ-104 and become more confident on creating and administrating Azure resources.
However I haven't got my certification yet, but I'm working on it.

I created this repository to showcase all of the resources I can create and administrate on Azure, some of them will be basic and other will contain more an advance set-up.
